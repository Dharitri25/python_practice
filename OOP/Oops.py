# Python OOPS
# Object Oriented Language
# Python is an object oriented language
# helps to structure the code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

# Advantage of OOP
# Provides a clear structure to program
# Makes code easy to maintain, reusable and easy to debug
# helps to code DRY (don't repeat yourself)
# allows to build reusable applications with less code

# CLASSES and OBJECTS
# classes and objects are the two core concepts in oop
# CLASS: it defines what an object should look like
# OBJECT: an object is created based on that class.
# example:
# Class   Object
# --------------
# Fruit   mango, banana, apple, grapes
# car     Audi, volvo, toyata, lamborghini

# when an object is created from a class, it inherits/uses all the variables and functions defined inside the class
